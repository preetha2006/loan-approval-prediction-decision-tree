## Overview

This project predicts whether a loan application will be approved using a **Decision Tree classifier**. The model analyzes applicant details such as income, credit history, loan amount, and employment information to support automated loan approval decisions.

## Dataset

The project uses a **loan approval dataset** containing applicant personal, financial, and credit-related attributes commonly used in banking and financial institutions.

## Approach

- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Handling missing values and categorical variables
- Training a Decision Tree classification model
- Evaluating model performance using standard metrics

## Evaluation Metrics

- Accuracy
- Precision, Recall, F1-score
- Confusion Matrix

## Tools & Technologies

- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib, Seaborn

## Purpose

This project is developed for academic and learning purposes to understand decision tree–based classification in financial applications.
